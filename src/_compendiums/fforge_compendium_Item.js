A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.

They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls. <br>\tAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career. <br>\tYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely lo make powerful connections.<br>\t <b><br>Wretched:</b> You live in inhumane conditions. With  no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the goad graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards.

dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol. <br>\tVenturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. <br>\tArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations. <br>\tLater, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. <br>\t <b><br>Magic Weapon:</b> The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The axe has the following randomly determined properties: <br>\t• 2 minor beneficial properties <br>\t• 1 major beneficial property <br>\t• 2 minor detrimental properties <br>\t <b><br>Blessings of Moradin:</b> If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits: <br>• You have immunity to poison damage. <br>• The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. <br>• You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry. <br>\t <b><br>Conjure Earth Elemental:</b> If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. <br>\t <b><br>Travel the Depths:</b> You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.<br>\t <b><br>Curse:</b> The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Axe:</b> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.<br><b><br>Proficiency:</b> martial, battleaxe<b><br>Source:</b> Dungeon Master's Guide p.

While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. Dawnbringer has all the properties of a sun blade: you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.<br>\tThe sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. <br>\tWhile holding the weapon, you an use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast lesser restoration on that creature. Once used. this ability can't be used again until the next dawn. <b><br>\tSentience:</b> Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. <br>\tThe sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you're attuned to it. <b><br>\tPersonality:</b> Forged by ancient sun worshipers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies. <br>\tLong years last in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.<br><b><br>Proficiency:</b> martial, longsword, shortsword<b><br>Source:</b> Out of the Abyss, p. 222","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/ring.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Weapon"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":"3"},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-evil alignment)"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[{"name":"melee attacks +2","value":" +2","enabled":1}]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[{"name":"melee damage +2","value":" +2","enabled":1}]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text","current":"1d8"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text","current":"1d10"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox","current":1},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox","current":1},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Defender Greatsword":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Defender Greatsword","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.<br>\tThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn.

Gurt's greataxe was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a frost giant adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep.

It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human. The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below O degrees Fahrenheit. The light can't be shut off in these conditions. As an action, you can cast a version of the heat metal spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage.

all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain. <br>\tA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. <br>\tA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods. <br>\tA moon blade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. <br>\tA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6+1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.<br>\t <b><br>MOONBLADE PROPERTIES:</b> <br>d100 — Property: <br>01-40 — Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus.<br>41-80 — The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property (see \"Special Features\" earlier in this chapter).<br>81-82 — The moonblade gains the finesse property.<br>83-84 — The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).<br>85-86 — The moonblade functions as a defender.<br>87-90 — The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.<br>91-92 — When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage.<br>93-94 — When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.<br>95-96 — You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.<br>97-98 — The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.<br>99 — You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.<br>00 — The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.<br>\t <b><br>Sentience:</b> A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. <br>\tThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. <br>\t <b><br>Personality:</b> Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose. <br>\tThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute. <br>\tIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.<br><b><br>Proficiency:</b> martial, longsword<b><br>Source:</b>

Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for \"orc,\" but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word \"orc\" is literally split in two.<b><br>\tYou gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:</b><br>\t• You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.<br>\t• When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.<br>\t• You can't be surprised by orcs while you're not incapacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.<br>\t• You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be frightened while you're not incapacitated. <b><br>\tSentience:</b> Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse. <b><br>\tPersonality:</b> Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves — giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs — and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.<br><b><br>Proficiency:</b> martial,

While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled.

This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. <br>\tFor a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. <br>\tThe Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. <br>\tIf the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The Sword of Kas has the following random properties: <br>\t• 1 minor beneficial property <br>\t• 1 major beneficial property <br>\t• 1 minor detrimental property <br>\t• 1 major detrimental property <br>\t <b><br>Spirit of Kas:</b> While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. <br>\t <b><br>Spells:</b> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. <br>\t <b><br>Sentience:</b> The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 range of 120 feet. <br>\tThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common <br>\t <b><br>Personality:</b> The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal. <br>\tThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Sword:</b> A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted.

If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit point maximum. <br>\tThe weapon also functions as a trident of fish command and a weapon of warning.

It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation. <br>\t <b><br>Personality:</b> When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods. <br>\tWave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to <br>\tfurther the weapon's objectives in the world. The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to- or rebellion against-that god. <br>\tWave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's demise.

At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky. <br>\t <b><br>Thrown Weapon:</b> Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet. <br>\t <b><br>Shock Wave:</b> You can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. <br>\t <b><br>Supernatural Awareness:</b> While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. <br>\t <b><br>Sentience:</b> Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. <br>\tThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat. <br>\t <b><br>Personality:</b> Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.<br><b><br>Proficiency:</b> martial, warhammer<b><br>Source:</b> Dungeon Master's Guide p.

Winter":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Ring of Winter","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"Artus Cimber (see appendix D) has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring. <br>\tThe Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see “Sentient Magic Items” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearer's doom. <br>\t <b><br>Sentience:</b> <br>\tThe Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. <br>\t <b><br>Nondetection:</b> <br>\tThe Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. <br>\t <b><br>Frozen Time:</b> <br>\tAs long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. <br>\t <b><br>Cold Immunity:</b> <br>\tWhile attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). <br>\t <b><br>Magic:</b> <br>\tThe Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties: <br>• You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of –30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute. <br>• You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2charges). <br>• You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary. <br>\t <b><br>Other Properties:</b> <br>\tThe Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Ring:</b> <br>\tThe ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Tomb of Annihilation, p. 207","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/ring.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Generic"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":""},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"artifact (requires attunement)"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox"},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox"},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Ring of X-ray Vision":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Ring of X-ray Vision","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word.

Etched into the skull's forehead is Acererak's rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death. <br>\t <b><br>Beneficial Properties:</b> <br>\tWhile the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits: <br>• Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled. <br>• You can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned. <br>• Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them. <br>• You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit. <br>\t <b><br>Invoke Curse:</b> <br>\tThe Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A greater restoration, remove curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target. <br>\t <b><br>The Forgotten One:</b> <br>\tThe bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects Acererak from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a dispel evil and good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Staff:</b>. A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess. <br>\tCasting the staff into a sphere of annihilation destroys both the staff and the life force trapped within it.

Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. <br>\tThe Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose. <br>\tA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings,. keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. <br>\tBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties: <br>\t• 2 minor beneficial properties <br>\t• 2 major beneficial properties <br>\t <b><br>Increased Wisdom:</b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. <br>\t <b><br>Enlightened Magic:</b> Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. <br>\t <b><br>Halo:</b> Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Book:</b> It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse.

No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness. <br>\tMost believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. <br>\tOther practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined. <br>\tNature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough. <br>\tA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within. <br>\tWhenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil. <br>\tThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties: <br>\t• 3 minor beneficial properties <br>\t• 1 major beneficial property <br>\t• 3 minor detrimental properties <br>\t• 2 major detrimental properties <br>\t <b><br>Adjusted Ability Scores:</b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again. <br>\t <b><br>Mark of Darkness:</b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. <br>\t <b><br>Command Evil:</b> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn. <br>\t <b><br>Dark Lore:</b> You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. <br>\t <b><br>Dark Speech:</b> While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Book:</b> The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome. <br>\tIf a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse. <br>\tA creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later. <br>\tIf all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Dungeon Master's Guide p. 222","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/book.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Generic"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":"5"},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"artifact (requires attunement)"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox"},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox"},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Boots of Elvenkind":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Boots of Elvenkind","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across.

Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect.

Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. <b><br>\tComet:</b> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect. <b><br>\tDonjon:</b> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. <b><br>\tEuryale:</b> The card's medusa-like visage curses you.

You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. <b><br>\tFlames:</b> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. <b><br>\tFool:</b> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws.

The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character. <b><br>\tMoon:</b> You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times. <b><br>\tRogue:</b> A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. <b><br>\tRuin:</b> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. <b><br>\tSkull:</b> You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as. yours. <b><br>\tVizier:</b> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it. <b><br>\tThe Void:</b> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it.

It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.<br>\tThe low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.<br>\tThose with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons — a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.<br>\tWithin 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.<br>\tFor any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence — because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.<br>\tWhile the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. <br><b><br>Source:</b> The Rise of Tiamat p. 93","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/hunting-horn.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Generic"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":""},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"unique"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox"},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox"},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Dread Helm":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Dread Helm","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"This fearsome steel helm makes your eyes glow red while you wear it.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 137","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/visored-helm.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Generic"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":""},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"common"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox"},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox"},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Driftglobe":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Driftglobe","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about. <br>\tOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower. <br>\tSome say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world. <br>\tThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity. <br>\tTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die. <br>\tTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties: <br>\t• 1 minor beneficial property <br>\t• 1 major beneficial property <br>\t• 1 minor detrimental property <br>\t <b><br>Properties of the Eye:</b> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: <br>\t• You have truesight. <br>\t• You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action. <br>\t• The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control. <br>\t <b><br>Properties of the Eye and Hand:</b> If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: <br>\t• You are immune to disease and poison. <br>\t• Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion. <br>\t• You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised. <br>\t• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1dl0 hit points. <br>\t• If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. <br>\t• You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Eye and Hand:</b> If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever.

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:<br>\t• The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.<br>\t• The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.<br>\t• The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about. <br>\tOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower. <br>\tSome say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world. <br>\tThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity. <br>\tTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die. <br>\tTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties: <br>\t• 1 minor beneficial property <br>\t• 1 major beneficial property <br>\t• 1 minor detrimental property <br>\t <b><br>Properties of the Hand:</b> Your alignment changes neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: <br>\t• Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher. <br>\t• Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit. <br>\t• The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you. <br>\t <b><br>Properties of the Eye and Hand:</b> If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: <br>\t• You are immune to disease and poison. <br>\t• Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion. <br>\t• You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised. <br>\t• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1dl0 hit points. <br>\t• If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. <br>\t• You can use an action to cast wish.

When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic. <br>\tAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons. <br>\tEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb. <br>\tAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. <br>\tWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. <br>\tWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties: <br>\t• 2 minor beneficial properties <br>\t• 1 minor detrimental property <br>\t• 1 major detrimental property <br>\t <b><br>Spells:</b> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges. <br>\t <b><br>Call Dragons:</b> While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying an Orb:</b> An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons.

The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet — the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated. <br>\tAfter the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership. <br>\tAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne. <br>\tAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic — the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master. <b><br>\tProperties of the Throne:</b> The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows: <br>• The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges. <br>• Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges. <br>• As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls. <br>• As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne. <br>• As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Throne:</b> The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Storm King's Thunder, p. 239","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/stone-throne.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Generic"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":""},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"artifact"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox"},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox"},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Wand of Binding":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Wand of Binding","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"This wand has 7 charges for the following properties.

The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal. <br>\tMade from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence. <br>\tAny creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie. <br>\tIn the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit. <br>\t <b><br>Random Properties:</b> The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties: <br>\t• 2 minor beneficial properties <br>\t• 1 major beneficial property <br>\t• 2 minor detrimental properties <br>\t• 1 major detrimental property <br>\tThe detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself. <br>\t <b><br>Protection:</b> You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand. <br>\t <b><br>Spells:</b> The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. <br>\tWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). <br>\t <b><br>Call Undead:</b> While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn. <br>\tWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. <br>\t <b><br>Sentience:</b> The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. <br>\tThe wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. <br>\t <b><br>Personality:</b> The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. <br>\t <b><br>Destroying the Wand:</b> Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life — no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. <br>\tBathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Dungeon Master's Guide p. 227","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Image","current":"content/FiveForge/icons/crystal-wand.svg"}},"attributes":{"itemType":{"name":"Item Type","editType":["Generic","Weapon","Armor","Container","Spellcasting"],"current":"Spellcasting"},"quantity":{"name":"Quantity","editType":"number","current":1},"weight":{"name":"Weight","editType":"number","current":"4"},"price":{"name":"Price","editType":"number"},"rarity":{"name":"Rarity","editType":"text","current":"artifact (requires attunement)"},"baseWeight":{"name":"Base Weight","editType":"number"},"attackBonus":{"name":"Attack Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[{"name":"melee attacks +3","value":" +3","enabled":1}]},"damageBonus":{"name":"Damage Bonus","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[{"name":"melee damage +3","value":" +3","enabled":1}]},"damageType":{"name":"Damage Type","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damageType2":{"name":"Damage Type 2","editType":["Acid","Bludgeoning","Cold","Fire","Force","Lightning","Necrotic","Piercing","Poison","Psychic","Radiant","Slashing","Thunder"],"current":"Slashing"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"text"},"damage2":{"name":"Damage 2","editType":"text"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"5 ft."},"ammunition":{"name":"Ammunition","editType":"checkbox"},"finesse":{"name":"Finesse","editType":"checkbox"},"heavy":{"name":"Heavy","editType":"checkbox"},"light":{"name":"Light","editType":"checkbox"},"loading":{"name":"Loading","editType":"checkbox"},"ranged":{"name":"Ranged","editType":"checkbox"},"reach":{"name":"Reach","editType":"checkbox"},"thrown":{"name":"Thrown","editType":"checkbox"},"twohanded":{"name":"Two-Handed","editType":"checkbox"},"versatile":{"name":"Versatile","editType":"checkbox"},"proficient":{"name":"Proficient","editType":"checkbox"},"armor":{"name":"Armor","editType":"number"},"armorType":{"name":"Armor Type","editType":["Shield","Light","Medium","Heavy"]},"equipped":{"name":"Equipped","editType":"checkbox"}},"tags":{}},"Wand of Paralysis":{"_t":"i","_type":"Item","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Wand of Paralysis","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"This wand has 7 charges.
