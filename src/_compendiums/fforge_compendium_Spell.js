This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. <br>\tSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. <b><br>\tTargeted Effects:</b> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. <b><br>\tAreas of Magic:</b> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. <b><br>\tSpells:</b> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. <b><br>\tMagic Items:</b> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. <b><br>\tMagical Travel:</b> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube.

Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.<b><br>\tAntipathy:</b> The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.<b><br>\tSympathy:</b> The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target.

The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand. <br>\tThe hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space. <br>\tWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it. <b><br>\tClenched Fist:</b> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage. <b><br>\tForceful Hand:</b> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. <b><br>\tGrasping Hand:</b> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6+your spellcasting ability modifier. <b><br>\tInterposing Hand:</b> The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score.

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph.The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. <br>\tThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. <br>\tYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. <br>\tYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. <br>\tWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. <b><br>\tExplosive Runes:</b> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. <b><br>\tSpell Glyph:</b> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell. <br>\tWhen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. <br>\tGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area. <b><br>\tCorridors:</b> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses. <b><br>\tDoors:</b> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell.

Place a suggestion in one location.

At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space.

Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>\tThe illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target. <br>\tWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. <b><br>\tBurial:</b> The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. <br>\tThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. <b><br>\tChaining:</b> Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. <br>\tThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. <b><br>\tHedged Prison:</b> The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. <br>\tThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.<b><br>\t Minimus Containment:</b> The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. <br>\tThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby. <b><br>\tSlumber:</b> The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. <br>\tThe special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. <b><br>\tEnding the Spell:</b> During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. <br>\tA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. <br>\tYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

The DM has the creature's statistics.<br>\tOn each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil.

The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body. <br>\tYou can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spells can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours. <br>\tOnce you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class feature. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features. <br>\tMeanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all. <br>\tWhile possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body.

If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. <br>\t<b><br>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration. <br><b><br>Source:</b> Player's Handbook, p. 258","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"spellType":{"name":"Type","editType":["Cast","Attack + Damage","Damage Only","Save + Damage"],"current":"Cast"},"school":{"name":"School","editType":["Abjuration","Enchantment","Conjuration","Illusion","Transmutation","Divination","Necromancy","Evocation"],"current":"Illusion"},"level":{"name":"Level","editType":{"0":"Cantrip","1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10"},"current":"3"},"components":{"name":"Components","editType":"text","current":"V, S, M   "},"materials":{"name":"Materials","editType":"text","current":"a bit of fleece"},"classes":{"name":"Classes","editType":"text","current":"Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard"},"time":{"name":"Cast Time","editType":"text","current":"1 action"},"duration":{"name":"Duration","editType":"text","current":"Concentration, up to 10 minutes"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"120 feet"},"saveAbility":{"name":"Save Ability","editType":"text","current":"Dexterity"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"ritual":{"name":"Ritual","editType":"checkbox","current":false},"prepared":{"name":"Prepared","editType":"checkbox","current":"0"}},"tags":{"Illusion":true,"Rogue ":true," Bard":true," Sorcerer":true," Warlock":true," Wizard":true}},"Maneuvering Attack":{"_t":"i","_type":"Spell","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Maneuvering Attack","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. <br>\tThe phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. <br>\tThe target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. <br>\tWhile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. <br>\tAn affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. <br>\tPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. <br>\tAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task m measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. <br>\tAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. <br>\tA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded. <br><b><br>Source:</b> Player's Handbook, p. 265","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"spellType":{"name":"Type","editType":["Cast","Attack + Damage","Damage Only","Save + Damage"],"current":"Cast"},"school":{"name":"School","editType":["Abjuration","Enchantment","Conjuration","Illusion","Transmutation","Divination","Necromancy","Evocation"],"current":"Conjuration"},"level":{"name":"Level","editType":{"0":"Cantrip","1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10"},"current":"6"},"components":{"name":"Components","editType":"text","current":"V, S"},"materials":{"name":"Materials","editType":"text"},"classes":{"name":"Classes","editType":"text","current":"Cleric"},"time":{"name":"Cast Time","editType":"text","current":"10 minutes"},"duration":{"name":"Duration","editType":"text","current":"Instantaneous"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"60 feet"},"saveAbility":{"name":"Save Ability","editType":"text","current":"Dexterity"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"ritual":{"name":"Ritual","editType":"checkbox","current":false},"prepared":{"name":"Prepared","editType":"checkbox","current":"0"}},"tags":{"Conjuration":true,"Cleric":true}},"Planar Binding":{"_t":"i","_type":"Spell","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Planar Binding","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service.

Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. <br>\tThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase. <br>\tPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Player's Handbook, p. 269","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"spellType":{"name":"Type","editType":["Cast","Attack + Damage","Damage Only","Save + Damage"],"current":"Cast"},"school":{"name":"School","editType":["Abjuration","Enchantment","Conjuration","Illusion","Transmutation","Divination","Necromancy","Evocation"],"current":"Illusion"},"level":{"name":"Level","editType":{"0":"Cantrip","1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10"},"current":"6"},"components":{"name":"Components","editType":"text","current":"V, S, M "},"materials":{"name":"Materials","editType":"text"},"classes":{"name":"Classes","editType":"text","current":"Bard, Wizard"},"time":{"name":"Cast Time","editType":"text","current":"1 action"},"duration":{"name":"Duration","editType":"text","current":"Until dispelled"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"120 feet"},"saveAbility":{"name":"Save Ability","editType":"text","current":"Dexterity"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"ritual":{"name":"Ritual","editType":"checkbox","current":false},"prepared":{"name":"Prepared","editType":"checkbox","current":"0"}},"tags":{"Illusion":true,"Bard":true," Wizard":true}},"Project Image":{"_t":"i","_type":"Spell","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Project Image","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration.

You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. <br>\tWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form.

The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. <br>\tIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shard a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it. <br>\tThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Player's Handbook, p. 277","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"spellType":{"name":"Type","editType":["Cast","Attack + Damage","Damage Only","Save + Damage"],"current":"Cast"},"school":{"name":"School","editType":["Abjuration","Enchantment","Conjuration","Illusion","Transmutation","Divination","Necromancy","Evocation"],"current":"Transmutation"},"level":{"name":"Level","editType":{"0":"Cantrip","1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10"},"current":"3"},"components":{"name":"Components","editType":"text","current":"V, S"},"materials":{"name":"Materials","editType":"text"},"classes":{"name":"Classes","editType":"text","current":"Bard, Druid, Ranger"},"time":{"name":"Cast Time","editType":"text","current":"1 action"},"duration":{"name":"Duration","editType":"text","current":"10 minutes"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"Self (30-foot radius)"},"saveAbility":{"name":"Save Ability","editType":"text","current":"Dexterity"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"ritual":{"name":"Ritual","editType":"checkbox","current":false},"prepared":{"name":"Prepared","editType":"checkbox","current":"0"}},"tags":{"Transmutation":true,"Bard":true," Druid":true," Ranger":true}},"Spider Climb":{"_t":"i","_type":"Spell","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Spider Climb","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. <br>\tThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. <br>\tYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. <br>\tYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. <br>\tWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table. <b><br>\tFamiliarity:</b><br>\tPermanent Circle — On Target 01-100<br>\tAssociated object — On Target 01-100<br>\tVery familiar — Mishap 01-05, Similar Area 06-13, Off Target 14-24, On Target 25-100<br>\tSeen casually — Mishap 1-33, Similar Area 34-43, Off Target 44-53, On Target 54-100<br>\tViewed once — Mishap 01-43, Similar Area 44-53, Off Target 54-73, On Target 74-100<br>\tDescription — Mishap 01-43, Similar Area 44-53, Off Target 54-73, On Target 74-100<br>\tFalse destination — Mishap 01-50, Similar Area 51-100<b><br>\tFamiliarity:</b> \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.<br>\t\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map. \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.<b><br>\tOn Target:</b> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.<b><br>\tOff Target:</b> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.<b><br>\tSimilar Area:</b> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.<b><br>\tMishap:</b> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).<br><b><br>Source:</b> Player's Handbook, p. 281","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"spellType":{"name":"Type","editType":["Cast","Attack + Damage","Damage Only","Save + Damage"],"current":"Cast"},"school":{"name":"School","editType":["Abjuration","Enchantment","Conjuration","Illusion","Transmutation","Divination","Necromancy","Evocation"],"current":"Conjuration"},"level":{"name":"Level","editType":{"0":"Cantrip","1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10"},"current":"7"},"components":{"name":"Components","editType":"text","current":"V"},"materials":{"name":"Materials","editType":"text"},"classes":{"name":"Classes","editType":"text","current":"Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard"},"time":{"name":"Cast Time","editType":"text","current":"1 action"},"duration":{"name":"Duration","editType":"text","current":"Instantaneous"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"10 feet"},"saveAbility":{"name":"Save Ability","editType":"text","current":"Dexterity"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"ritual":{"name":"Ritual","editType":"checkbox","current":false},"prepared":{"name":"Prepared","editType":"checkbox","current":"0"}},"tags":{"Conjuration":true,"Bard":true," Sorcerer":true," Wizard":true}},"Teleportation Circle":{"_t":"i","_type":"Spell","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Teleportation Circle","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you.

Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.<br>\tIn addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.<br>\tFinally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).<br>\tThe temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. <br>\tThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: <br>\t• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. <br>\t• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. <br>\t• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. <br>\t• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack. <br>\t• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. <br>\tYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance, the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. <br>\tThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.<br><b><br>Source:</b> Player's Handbook, p. 288","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"spellType":{"name":"Type","editType":["Cast","Attack + Damage","Damage Only","Save + Damage"],"current":"Cast"},"school":{"name":"School","editType":["Abjuration","Enchantment","Conjuration","Illusion","Transmutation","Divination","Necromancy","Evocation"],"current":"Conjuration"},"level":{"name":"Level","editType":{"0":"Cantrip","1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10"},"current":"9"},"components":{"name":"Components","editType":"text","current":"V, S, M "},"materials":{"name":"Materials","editType":"text"},"classes":{"name":"Classes","editType":"text","current":"Sorcerer, Wizard"},"time":{"name":"Cast Time","editType":"text","current":"1 action"},"duration":{"name":"Duration","editType":"text","current":"Instantaneous"},"range":{"name":"Range","editType":"text","current":"Self"},"saveAbility":{"name":"Save Ability","editType":"text","current":"Dexterity"},"damage":{"name":"Damage","editType":"modifierEdit","current":[]},"ritual":{"name":"Ritual","editType":"checkbox","current":false},"prepared":{"name":"Prepared","editType":"checkbox","current":"0"}},"tags":{"Conjuration":true,"Sorcerer":true," Wizard":true}},"Witch Bolt":{"_t":"i","_type":"Spell","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Witch Bolt","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.
