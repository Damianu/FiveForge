They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.<br>\tWhile jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.<br>\tFor the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.<br>\tJesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.<br>\tJesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant.

Then refer to the Common Beast Shapes table that corresponds to the region you selected. That table lists the beasts you can choose from, based on your druid level. The table presents the animals that a druid is most likely to have seen as a novice, to have learned about through mystic research, or to have a special affinity with. <br>\tEach time you gain a druid level later, you can choose one more beast shape from the same table you used at 2nd level.<br>\t <br>Gaining Beast Shapes:<br>\tIn addition to the beast shapes you gain for free when you level up, you can acquire new shapes on your adventures. Do you see a dinosaur, a saber-toothed tiger, a giant eagle, or some other exotic critter that you want to turn into? This rule gives you a method for learning how to do so. It requires you to abide by the limitations in the Wild Shape feature (see the Beast Shapes table in the Player's Handbook, page 66). <br>\tWhen you see a beast whose shape you'd like to learn, you have two options: <br>\t <br>Observation: <br>\tYou learn the beast's shape after observing its behavior for at least 1 hour and succeeding on an Intelligence (Nature) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast's challenge rating.

For this interaction period, you must be within 15 feet of the beast, and if you spend at least a minute petting it, you have advantage on the check. <br>\t <br>\tEither of these options can be assisted by magic.

Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting. <br>\t <br>Psionic Talents: <br>\tA psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. You learn an additional talent at 3rd, 10th, and 17th level. <br>\t <br>Psionic Disciplines: <br>\tA psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time. <br>\tAt 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. You learn an additional discipline of your choice at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level.<br>\tIn addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice. <br>\t <br>Psi Points: <br>\tYou have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points. <br>\tThe number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level: 4 points at 1st level, 6 at 2nd, 14 at 3rd, 17 at 4th, 27 at 5th, 32 at 6th, 38 at 7th, 44 at 8th, 57 at 9th, 64 at 10th, and 71 at 18th.. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum. <br>\t <br>Psi Limit: <br>\tThough you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level; at 1st level, your psi limit is 2, and it increases to 3 at 3rd, 5 at 5th, 6 at 7th, and 7 at 9th.  For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have. <br>\t <br>Psychic Focus: <br>\tYou can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it.

Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.<br>\t <br>Tenets of the Crown:<br>\tThe tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.<br>\t <br>Law: The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.<br>\t <br>Loyalty: Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.<br>\t <br>Courage: You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?<br>\t <br>Responsibility: You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations. <br>\t <br>Oath Spells:<br>\tYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.<br>\t <br>3rd — command, compelled duel<br>5th — warding bond, zone of truth<br>9th — aura of vitality, spirit guardians<br>13th — banishment, guardian of faith<br>17th — circle of power, geas<br>\t<br>","editType":"longText"},"img":{"name":"Icon","current":"/content/FiveForge/icons/swap-bag.svg","editType":"iconPicker"}},"attributes":{"source":{"name":"Source","editType":"text","current":"Paladin"}}},"Channel Divinity: Champion Challenge (Oath of the Crown)":{"_t":"i","_type":"Trait","info":{"name":{"name":"Name","current":"Channel Divinity: Champion Challenge (Oath of the Crown)","editType":"text"},"notes":{"name":"Notes","current":"As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you.

Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure. <br>\tMany of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery. <br>\t <br>Fallen Paladins: <br>\tThe Oath of Treachery is an option for the paladin who has strayed from another Sacred Oath or who has rejected the traditional paladin life. This option exists alongside the Oathbreaker in the Dungeon Master's Guide. DMs are free to use either option to model villainous or fallen paladins. <br>\tIf you switch to this oath from another one, replace all of the previous oath's features with the features of this one, and if you renounce this oath, replace its features with the features of the new one. <br>\t <br>Tenets of Treachery: <br>\tA paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one.

Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple. <br>\t <br>Fight the Greater Evil: Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>\tFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>\tYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.<br>\tFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.

You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.<br>\tIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
